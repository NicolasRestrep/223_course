# 223 - Introduction to Data Science 

Hi folks, welcome to the repository for the Introduction to Data Science course. Here, you are going to find: 

1) Supplementary exercises for the materials we will cover. 
2) New data we use for the exercises, as well as other interesting datasets that you can play around with.

In the course we are going to be using two books: [A Modern Dive into R and the Tidyverse](https://moderndive.com/) and [Data Visualization](https://socviz.co/). Both are excellent resources, and what we tried to do here was to build off them to give you the opportunity to practice the skills associated with each chapter. The supplementary exercises are under the `homework` folder. The files whose names start with `sv_` go along with the Data Visualization book. The rest are complementary exercises for ModernDive. The `Data` folder includes all necessary datasets, as well as a file called `data_documentation.md` that describes the data and where we got it from. 

Enjoy!
