I'm going to go through the examples in the *ModernDive* text.

### Democracy Scores

If you haven't done this before you can load data from your hard drive instead of grabbing it off the internet. Here's a link to some data: https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv. If you save this in a folder called **`MD-Data`** somewhere in your project folder, the code below will work.

There's a small wrinkle here that I will explain in class. The problem is that the file I'm working in is in the `demos` subfolder and the data I need is in a different subfolder (`MD-data`). When projects get complicated, the **`here`** package is super useful. You will have to install it if this your first time using it on your current machine.

```{r}
library(here)

dem_score <- read_csv(here("MD-Data", "dem_score.csv"))

dem_score |> head(10)
```

This is what is called "wide form." A lot of data comes like this. It's not "tidy." Let's make it tidy.

```{r}
ds_tidy <- dem_score |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = `1952`:`1992`,    # the names of the columns with the values
               names_to = "year",       # the name of the new key variable
               values_to = "score") |>  # the name of the new value variable
  mutate(yearnum = as.integer(year))    # (see below)

ds_tidy |> head(20)
```

Why do you think I added that `mutate()` step? In what situations might that matter? (I will show a better way later but let's go with this for now.)

Let's take a brief digression and see. Let's keep only a few countries.

```{r}
ds_tidy_small <- ds_tidy |> 
  filter(country %in% c("China", 
                        "Korea, Rep.",
                        "Mexico",
                        "Russia",
                        "Argentina"))
```

Here's the version with `year` (a character variable).

```{r}
ggplot(ds_tidy_small,
       aes(x = year,
           y = score,
           group = country,
           color = country)) +
  geom_line(size = 2,
            alpha = .6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Score",
       color = "",
       title = "Democracy Scores for Five Countries, 1952-1992") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

Here's the version with `yearnum` (an integer variable).

```{r}
ggplot(ds_tidy_small,
       aes(x = yearnum,
           y = score,
           group = country,
           color = country)) +
  geom_line(size = 2,
            alpha = .6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Score",
       color = "",
       title = "Democracy Scores for Five Countries, 1952-1992") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

The second version (`yearnum`) is an actual numeric variable. So it treats it differently than the character version.

We could do this as part of the `pivot_longer()` function like this:

```{r}
ds_tidy <- dem_score |>
  pivot_longer(`1952`:`1992`,
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "score",
               names_transform = list(year = as.integer))
ds_tidy |> head(20)
```


### Drinks example

Let's grab the next dataset from the **`fivethirtyeight`** package. You will need to install it if you haven't already.

The dataset is called `drinks`. You can find out more about it by typing `?fivethirtyeight::drinks` in the console (i.e., **NOT** in your Markdown document).

```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)
glimpse(drinks)
```

This is the average number of servings of this drink type per person in each country. (The data are from 2010.)

Let's look at the structure.

```{r}
drinks |> head()
```

This dataset isn't tidy either. And since we're interested in servings only at this point, let's get rid of the `total_litres` column. 

Take a moment and imagine what a tidy version of this dataset would look like! (Seriously, do it.)

```{r}
drinks_long <- drinks |>
  select(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = -country,
               names_to = "type",
               values_to = "servings")

drinks_long |> head(10)
```

The `type` names are a bit redundant. We can rename them with `rename()` but we have to do that before the pivot. Otherwise, it's trickier. So let's do it again.

```{r}
drinks_long <- drinks |>
  rename(beer = beer_servings,
         spirit = spirit_servings,
         wine = wine_servings) |> 
  select(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = -country,
               names_to = "type",
               values_to = "servings")

drinks_long |> head(10)
```

Having data in this form makes graphing easier. Let's try looking at drink consumption in a few countries.

```{r}
drinks_long |> 
  filter(country %in% c("USA",
                        "United Kingdom",
                        "France",
                        "China")) |> 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = country,
        y = servings,
        fill = type,
        color = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "# of servings per person per year",
       title = "Alcohol consumption by type and country, 2010") +
  theme_minimal()
```
