```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

```{r}
data(gapminder, package = "gapminder")
```

The distribution of GDP per capita isn't normal (i.e., not "bell shaped") as we can see here.

```{r}
qplot(gdpPercap,
      data = gapminder,
      geom = "density")
```

Let's take 500 replicate samples of 100 country-years and then plot the resulting mean GDPs.

```{r}
set.seed(1108)

my_means <- gapminder |>
  select(gdpPercap) |> 
  rep_sample_n(size = 100,
               reps = 500) |> 
  group_by(replicate) |> 
  summarize(mean = mean(gdpPercap))

qplot(mean,
      data = my_means,
      geom = "density")

```

This is pretty normally distributed!
